## Context

* Very short deadline
* Good knowledge Java and Spring Boot
* Potential need to expand the application later in the training
* No performance requirements
* [Business requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pLz4b3s0on740eHurzmsWFknPNDqCBf7KCxRCMQFfcY/edit#heading=h.o3xdh29apzf)

## Solution

1. Simple plain Java project with output in the console

+ Quick implementation

- No extension possible

2. More complicated Spring Boot project

+ Possibility of extension

- Longer implementation

## Decision

Solution #2 was chosen because good knowledge of technology allowed for the rapid creation of a new project
that can be further developed during the training.
